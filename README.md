**Example Tutor Mode Dialogue:**
```
AI: Let's explore Python functions. What do you think a function is?
You: A reusable block of code?
AI: Good start! Why would we want to make code reusable?
You: To avoid repeating ourselves?
AI: Exactly! Can you think of a real-world example where you'd use a function?
You: Maybe calculating the area of different circles?
AI: Perfect! Now let's explore how we'd write that...
```

## The Science: Make It Stick Principles

This platform implements research-backed learning strategies:

### 1. Spaced Repetition
- Review intervals increase with each successful recall
- Uses the SM-2 algorithm (same as Anki)
- Optimizes long-term retention

### 2. Retrieval Practice
- Active recall strengthens memory traces
- Testing effect: taking tests improves learning more than re-reading
- Self-assessment builds metacognition

### 3. Interleaving
- Mix different topics in a single session
- Creates desirable difficulty
- Improves discrimination and transfer

### 4. Elaboration
- Connect new information to existing knowledge
- AI generates "why" and "how" questions
- Deepens understanding

### 5. Generation
- Try to answer before seeing the solution
- Produces stronger memory encoding
- Even wrong answers help learning

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
- Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Check all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Frontend can't connect to API
- Ensure backend is running on port 8000
- Check CORS settings in `backend/app/main.py`
- Verify API_BASE in `frontend/app.js` matches your backend URL

### AI questions not generating
- Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to `backend/.env`
- Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
- Check API quota and billing
- Fallback questions will be created if AI is unavailable

### Database issues
- Delete `data/learning_platform.db` to reset
- Backup database before resetting: `cp data/learning_platform.db data/backup.db`

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Collaborative learning (share topics)
- Import from Anki/Quizlet
- Voice input for answers
- Gamification (achievements, levels)
- Export learning analytics
- Offline mode
- Browser extension
- Study reminders
