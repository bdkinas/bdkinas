# Tutor Mode Guide - Deep Learning with AI

Welcome to Tutor Mode - a revolutionary way to learn that goes beyond quizzes to truly teach through Socratic dialogue and personalized instruction.

## Philosophy

Tutor Mode is based on research showing that **deep learning happens through questioning, not just answering**. Instead of testing what you know, the AI coach:

1. **Probes your understanding** with "why" and "how" questions
2. **Identifies knowledge gaps** and misconceptions
3. **Provides just-in-time teaching** exactly when you need it
4. **Guides you to discover** answers yourself
5. **Tracks your understanding depth** using Bloom's Taxonomy

## Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

The system assesses and develops your understanding through six levels:

### 1. **Remember** (Recall)
- Can you recall facts and basic concepts?
- Example: "What is a function?"

### 2. **Understand** (Comprehend)
- Can you explain ideas in your own words?
- Example: "Why would we use functions?"

### 3. **Apply** (Use)
- Can you use concepts in new situations?
- Example: "Write a function to calculate area"

### 4. **Analyze** (Break Down)
- Can you break down complex ideas?
- Example: "What are the components of this function?"

### 5. **Evaluate** (Judge)
- Can you justify decisions and critique?
- Example: "Which approach is better and why?"

### 6. **Create** (Generate)
- Can you generate new ideas and solutions?
- Example: "Design a system using these concepts"

## Learning Modes

### üîç Exploration Mode
**Purpose**: Discover what you already know

The AI starts with open-ended questions to map your current knowledge:
- "What do you know about X?"
- "How does X relate to Y?"
- "Can you give me an example?"

**Best for**: Starting a new topic, warming up, activating prior knowledge

**Example Session**:
```
AI: Let's explore recursion. What comes to mind when you hear that word?
You: Something that repeats?
AI: Interesting! Can you think of examples from real life where things repeat?
You: Like a mirror reflecting a mirror?
AI: Excellent analogy! How might that apply to programming?
```

### üéØ Depth Check Mode
**Purpose**: Assess how deeply you understand a concept

The AI uses progressively deeper questions to evaluate your Bloom's level:
1. Starts with recall ("What is X?")
2. Moves to understanding ("Why does X work?")
3. Tests application ("How would you use X here?")
4. Probes analysis ("What's the difference between X and Y?")

**Best for**: Before exams, checking prerequisites, identifying weak areas

**You'll receive**:
- Your current Bloom's level for this concept
- Specific knowledge gaps identified
- Recommended next steps

### üìö Teaching Mode
**Purpose**: Learn new concepts with AI guidance

The AI acts as a patient teacher:
- Explains core concepts clearly
- Uses analogies and examples
- Checks understanding frequently
- Adjusts explanation based on your responses

**Best for**: Learning new material, clarifying confusion

**Teaching flow**:
1. AI explains core concept
2. Provides examples
3. Asks checking questions
4. Adapts based on your answers
5. Provides additional examples as needed

### üí™ Practice Mode
**Purpose**: Apply concepts in realistic scenarios

The AI presents scenarios where you must apply your knowledge:
- Real-world problems
- Code debugging challenges
- Design decisions
- Troubleshooting situations

**Best for**: Moving from understanding to application

**Example**:
```
AI: You're building a web app and notice it's slow. How would you approach debugging this?
You: Check the database queries?
AI: Good thinking! What specifically about the queries would you check?
You: If they're taking too long?
AI: Right! How would you measure that?
```

### ü§î Reflection Mode
**Purpose**: Develop metacognition - thinking about your thinking

The AI guides you to reflect on your learning:
- What did you learn today?
- What was challenging and why?
- How does this connect to other knowledge?
- What strategies worked well?

**Best for**: End of study sessions, weekly reviews, developing learning skills

**Benefits**:
- Consolidates learning
- Identifies effective strategies
- Builds self-awareness
- Improves future learning

### üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path Mode
**Purpose**: Follow a structured curriculum

The system creates a personalized learning sequence:
- Maps out all concepts in a topic
- Manages prerequisites (must learn A before B)
- Tracks your progress through the path
- Adapts based on your mastery

**Best for**: Systematic learning, mastering entire subjects

## How the AI Adapts

### Understanding Signals
The AI detects:
- **Confidence**: Do you express certainty or uncertainty?
- **Depth**: Are you giving surface answers or deep explanations?
- **Misconceptions**: Are there errors in your understanding?
- **Engagement**: Are you asking questions? Providing examples?

### Next Move Decision
Based on your signals, the AI chooses to:

**If you seem confused (low confidence)**:
‚Üí Provide clear, encouraging explanation with examples

**If you partially understand**:
‚Üí Ask guiding questions to help you discover the answer

**If you understand well**:
‚Üí Challenge you with deeper questions (analyze, evaluate)

**If you've mastered it**:
‚Üí Extend to novel applications and connections

## Tips for Effective Tutor Mode Sessions

### 1. Be Honest About Understanding
If you're unsure, say so! The AI adapts better when you're honest.

**Good**: "I think functions are about reusability, but I'm not sure why that matters"
**Less Good**: Pretending you understand when you don't

### 2. Think Out Loud
Share your reasoning process:

**Good**: "I think we'd use a loop here because... wait, or maybe recursion since it's a tree structure?"
**Less Good**: Just giving the final answer

### 3. Ask Questions
The AI is here to teach! Ask:
- "Why does that work?"
- "What's the difference between X and Y?"
- "Can you give me another example?"

### 4. Connect to Prior Knowledge
Make connections:
- "This reminds me of..."
- "Is this similar to..."
- "How does this relate to..."

### 5. Use Reflection Mode Regularly
Weekly reflection sessions help consolidate learning and identify patterns.
